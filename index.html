                        The Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of New Westminster is proposing to redevelop, upgrade and restore the Holy Eucharist Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral located at 501 4th Ave and clergy residence located at 408 Fifth St. These properties once consolidated would be home of Hub of Education and Urban Christian Community consisting of two separate buildings situated over a below grade common vehicular parking structure.

                        With the removal of the existing aged structures, land becomes available to accommodate new on-site facilities. <br>The proposed facilities program includes:<br> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>A mix of Rental Apartments (25 units)</li>
                            <li>Not-for-profit daycare (49 children)</li>
                            <li>A small Community Room</li>
                            <li>A new at-grade entrance into the Parish Hall, located below the Cathedral</li>
                            <li>Below-grade parking for 33 vehicles</li>
                        </ul>
                        Based on our dialog with the City of New Westminster planning group thus far, our team is optimistic in achieving a truly successful legacy for the Eparchy and its neighboring community. The mix of new uses on-site are intended to make excellent use of Eparchy's land by adhering to the Zoning Bylaw, respecting site context and subscribing to environmental sustainable practices.

                    <p>The Holy Eucharist Ukrainian Cathedral is a large, rectangular Modern church building with a flat roof and central
                      copper dome located on 4th avenue at the corner of 5th street in New Westminster, British Columbia.
                    </p>
                    <p>Constructed in 1968-69, the Holy Eucharist Ukrainian Cathedral is valued as the see of the Bishop of the New
                      Westminster Ukrainian Greek Catholic Eparchy, governing the Eparchy's 12 parishes of British Columbia.
                      The temple-like, formal design, and its high-visibility corner location and siting, give the church building
                      the air of a landmark.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This church and hall complex symbolizes the culmination of over 25 years of effort by local Ukrainian
                      Catholics to achieve an adequate and permanent parish in New Westminster, starting in 1941 at the Holy
                      Spirit church in the Queensborough neighbourhood, followed by two subsequent attempts in the 1950s
                      and 60s to formalize the St. George’s parish in different locations before the current property was
                      developed. The unrelenting fundraising, organization and perseverance of this community, resulting in a
                      successful and well-functioning church and hall, was likely one of the reasons this parish was chosen by
                      the Major Archbishop of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church (UGCC) as the cathedral and headquarters
                      for a new Eparchy in British Columbia when it was established in 1974.

                  <div>
                  <p>The architectural design is very significant in that it represents a Modern, mid-century interpretation of a
                    traditional Byzantine basilica, illustrating the optimism and progress envisioned in urban renewal
                    approaches of the 1960s era and the relevancy of the engaged and forward-thinking parish of the time,
                    while still paying homage to Catholic and Ukrainian church design traditions and symbols. Byzantine in
                    its square footprint and capped by a dome, the simplified, rectangular form is punctuated by tall, slim
                    windows which emulate the rhythm of classical columns. A prominent element of the facade is the over-
                    scaled stairway, adding a formality to the ascent to the central front doors, not unlike the experience at a
                    classical temple or courthouse. The design’s formality is softened through the use of pared-down, flat
                    architectural elements which give the church its Modern identity along with the use of trending 1960s
                    finishes such as stucco and aluminum-frame windows. The balance of Modern and traditional treatments
                    continue on the interior where colourful byzantine icons and wood-carved furnishings embellish an
                    otherwise rectilinear and naturally-lit Modern space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Holy Eucharist church holds further value for its association with its designer, architect Bing Gregory
                    Marr (1926-1991) who is remembered as one of the first registered Chinese-Canadian architects in BC.
                    His firm, B. G. Marr & Associates, was known for Modern apartment buildings and complexes and was
                    co-author of an important 1969 study commissioned by the City of Vancouver - “Restoration Report: The
                    Case for Renewed Life in the Old City”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Holy Eucharist church is valued not only as a continuous sacred site for New Westminster’s Ukrainian
                    Catholic community, but also as a community-wide venue since the doors opened, with the church hall
                    serving a diversity of community groups, with and without religious affiliations. The church hall has been
                    a place of celebration of important moments in the life of the parish family and of the community at
                    large from birthdays and chrismations to weddings and funeral receptions; hosted endless events from
                    perogy dinners, bridge club nights, bingo nights, art, dance and singing classes, community meals,
                    fundraisers, as well as a plethora of courses and cultural events contributing to the preservation of
                    Ukrainian culture, language and traditions. Today, the church hall is a seven-day-a-week work-horse
                    venue, functioning as a daycare on weekdays and as a community venue in the evenings and weekends.</p>
